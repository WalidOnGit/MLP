1. Objective

The objective of this assignment was to build a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using NumPy
to classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative.

The process followed a clear pipeline: cleaning the text, extracting sentence-level sentiment features,
encoding labels, splitting the data into training/validation/test sets, and training the neural network
using mini-batch gradient descent.

2. Model Setup

Each review was represented using only two numerical features:
- VADER compound polarity score
- TextBlob polarity score

The neural network consisted of:
- 2 input features
- 1 hidden layer with 16 ReLU neurons
- 1 sigmoid output neuron
- Binary Cross-Entropy loss
- Mini-batch gradient descent (learning rate = 0.05)

3. Training Behavior

The loss decreased sharply in the first few epochs, showing that the model quickly learned useful
patterns from the data. After roughly 100–150 epochs, both training and validation losses stabilized,
indicating convergence.

Importantly, the training and validation curves remained close to each other throughout training,
suggesting that the model did not significantly overfit.

4. Performance

Validation Accuracy: 0.7693
Test Accuracy: 0.7718

Confusion Matrix (Test Set):
[2801  904]
[793 2940]

The validation and test accuracies are very similar, which indicates good generalization.
The confusion matrix shows that the model performs fairly evenly across both classes,
with comparable numbers of false positives and false negatives.

5. Interpretation and Limitations

Achieving around 77% test accuracy using only two sentence-level polarity features is a strong result.
However, polarity-based methods have limitations. They may struggle with sarcasm, negation,
and reviews that contain mixed sentiment where positive and negative wording offsets each other.

6. Conclusion

Overall, this experiment demonstrates that even simple lexicon-based sentiment features can provide
meaningful predictive power when combined with a properly implemented neural network.
Despite its simplicity, the MLP achieved stable learning and solid generalization performance.
